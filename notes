now think the fiture seniero that df10 has 100million rows  and df_codes has 10k rows with cgls

now the task is to check the cgl is valid or not from the df_codes df

if cgl in df_codes then "cgl"

if the cgl in df_10 doesnt present in the df_codes then 
case 1:
if cgl starts with 5 then replace cgl with 5000000000
case 2:
replace with 1111111111

now we will get same cgl codes now we have to make the groupby and agg and sum of transactions and amounts-debit and credit





now based in the result i have to add the record 
case 1 :
if the dr + cr ==0 do nothing

case 2:
if dr > cr 
eg-
100+ -50 then add a record with same data by debit as 0 and credit as -50
then when we make groupby and sum aggregation the balance become 0
